# Introduction to Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the process of creating a basic visual guide or skeletal outline of a digital product, such as a website or mobile application. It focuses on the **structure, layout, and placement of elements** rather than colors, images, or detailed design.  

A wireframe serves as the **blueprint** of a product, helping designers, developers, and stakeholders understand how the interface will function before moving into detailed design or development.

## Why is Wireframing Important?
Wireframing plays a crucial role in the design process because it:  

- **Clarifies Structure** – Defines the arrangement of elements like navigation, content, and functionality.  
- **Encourages Early Feedback** – Helps stakeholders visualize the product and suggest improvements before detailed design begins.  
- **Saves Time and Resources** – Making changes in a wireframe is easier and more cost-effective than revising high-fidelity designs or developed code.  
- **Enhances Collaboration** – Serves as a communication tool between designers, developers, and clients, ensuring everyone is aligned on the product vision.  

In summary, wireframing transforms abstract ideas into tangible representations, ensuring that the final product is both user-friendly and aligned with project goals.
